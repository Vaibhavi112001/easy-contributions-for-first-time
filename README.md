Make sure you add your name to the middle of the list! Not end or beginning!!!

5. Now go to `https://github.com/<yourusernamehere>/easy-contributions-for-first-time`, make sure to replace the `<yourusernamehere>` with your real GitHub username, and on the top you should see a button that says, `add-glaukiol1 had recent changes, start a pull request?`, it is diffferent based on your translation. Start the pull request and fill out the description. Good luck!
